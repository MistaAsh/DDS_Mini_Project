##### These procedure steps will be followed on the simulator

1. First, we navigate to the simulator using the the navbar on the top of the screen. 
<br>

2. Upon opening the simulator, we see that the full-subtractor circuit built with XOR, OR, NOT and AND gates with default input given as A=0, B=0 and Bin=0.
<br>

3. The input values can be changed using by clicking on the circular blue button which toggles between 0 and 1 to simulate the high and low signals.
<br>

4. It can be observed that upon changing the input values the outputs, D and Bout, also change accordingly.
<br>

5. Now, to implement the stuck-at 0 faults, specific buttons are placed on the input and output wires, enabled with ON-OFF toggling, where Red box signifies stuck-at 0 fault existing on that particular wire.
<br>

6. After assigning inputs and enabling the required faults, we then click 'ADD' to append the inputs/outputs to the table and check if it differs from the expected output or not.
